# Questify
Questify is a real life leveling system that turns your daily grind into a game. This isn’t some boring tracker app or random habit checklist. This is your life, gamified. Workouts, missions, XP, stats, ranks – everything here is designed so you can level up like a true hunter, push yourself harder every day, and see real progress in the stuff that actually matters.

## What is Questify?
Questify is an XP-based system for tracking personal growth, daily tasks, workouts, and special missions. You get XP for completing tasks, level up your stats, increase your rank, and unlock new challenges. Think of it like a Solo Leveling IRL system but for your life. Every day is a grind, every XP point counts, and every mission completed gets you closer to leveling up your real-life self.

## How it Works
Questify works in three main layers:

1. **Daily Missions and Tasks**  
   - These are the grind missions, stuff you do every day to rack up XP. Workouts, studying, business hustle, anything that moves you forward IRL.  

2. **Special Missions**  
   - High-risk, high-reward challenges. These give massive XP and can unlock rare IRL rewards or next-level challenges. Think of these like bosses in a game.  

3. **Leveling, Stats, and Ranks**  
   - Every XP you earn contributes to your level. Leveling up can increase your stats, unlock new missions, and move you up the Hunter ranks. Ranks go from E → D → C → B → A → S → SS → SSS → SSS+ / Transcend.  
   - Stats are tracked separately and reflect your real-life progress: strength, agility, stamina, focus, etc.
