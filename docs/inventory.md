# Inventory System

The Inventory system defines how items behave, not how they are stored.

## Purpose

- Validate item structure
- Define item categories and rarity
- Describe item effects

## Item Types

- Consumables: temporary boosts
- Equipment: permanent stat modifiers
- Key Items: unlock content or missions

## Design Rules

- Inventory logic does not store player data
- Items are immutable definitions
- Effects are applied by systems, not items themselves

Inventory exists to give structure and meaning to rewards.
