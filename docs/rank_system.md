# Rank System
Ranks represent long-term progression and overall mastery.

Ranks are determined purely by level, not XP directly.

## Rank Progression
Ranks follow a tier-based structure:

E → D → C → B → A → S → SS → SSS → SSS+

Each rank spans a level range defined in configuration.

Reaching a new rank is a milestone event and may unlock:
- New mission types
- Higher XP rewards
- Boss missions
- New system features

## Rank Logic
The system always assigns the highest possible rank for the current level.
Rank updates can be automatic or manual depending on system settings.

Ranks do not reset.
Leveling continues indefinitely even after reaching the highest rank tier.
