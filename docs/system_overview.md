# Questify System Overview
Questify is an XP-based real-life progression system designed to turn daily actions into measurable growth. The system tracks XP, levels, stats, missions, and ranks in a structured way so progress is clear, motivating, and scalable.

This is not a habit tracker.
This is not a checklist.
This is a system.

Every action you take feeds into XP. XP feeds into levels. Levels affect stats and rank. Rank defines your overall progression.

The system is modular by design. Rules and balance live in configuration files, logic lives in core modules, and user progress is stored separately. This allows easy tuning, expansion, and future features without breaking the foundation.

## Core Pillars
- XP-driven progression
- Clear level and rank milestones
- Separate stat growth system
- Mission-based motivation
- Configurable and scalable architecture

Questify is built to be extended. Whether used solo or expanded into a community system, the core logic remains consistent.
