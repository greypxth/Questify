# Mission System
Missions are structured actions designed to drive consistent effort and challenge.

## Mission Types
### Daily Missions
- Repeatable
- Low to medium XP
- Form the base of daily progression

### Special Missions
- Limited frequency
- High XP reward
- Designed to push limits

### Boss Missions
- Unlocked at higher levels
- Very high risk and reward
- Represent major real-life challenges

## Mission Rules
- Daily mission limits exist
- Special missions are capped weekly
- Boss missions unlock based on level or rank
- Mission completion feeds XP, not direct stat boosts

Missions are designed to be flexible so users can adapt them to their own goals while keeping system integrity.
